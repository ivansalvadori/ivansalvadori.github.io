This article is a review of Curry, E. (2020). Real-time Linked Dataspaces. Springer International Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29665-0

* Preliminaries 
It starts describing challenges in handling data integration and its corresponding activities. It also discusses the number of connected devices from IoT-based infrastructure, producing a huge amount of data. Traditional approaches to data management are not sufficient to deal with it. As a result, it is increasing the number of data silos. A paradigm shift is necessary to overcome the challenges. Moreover, a new class of information management and processing system is required to support distributed real-time applications. These systems have to be able to handle semantically heterogeneous databases and perform integration involving thousands of data sources.

The Pareto principle says that 20% of the effort delivers 80% of the results.
This has been valid for many aspects of computer science.
For example, 20% of bugs that cause 80% of the system crashes.
However, the current way large-scale data ecosystem infrastructures are designed does not fit that principle.
This book is a step towards unlocking the Pareto effect over data.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"This book explores the dataspace paradigm as an alternative best-effort approach
to data management with data ecosystems. 
It establishes the theoretical foundations and principles of Real-time Linked Dataspaces as a data platform for intelligent systems, and introduces a set of specialised best-effort techniques and models to enable loose administrative proximity and semantic integration for managing and processing events and streams."
